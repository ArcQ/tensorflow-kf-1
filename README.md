#tf-kf-1
deep q learning for kf1game

###Development
install or link in kf-game-engine and kf-utils
make sure in kf1, there is a build-node process, modify the path to 
build the webassembly binary and copy into src/game/wasm (so the rust code)

kf-game-engine and kf-utils will have node specific code to coordinate
the webassembly game logic written in rust
